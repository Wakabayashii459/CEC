Hi, 

In the directories only the Strategy1/2/3 holds the ALL stock with the name itself as a ticker from yfinance module. In all of these there directories also hold 
IndividualResults and Results subdirectories, which have the text files of results

* In IndividualResults subdirectory, each strategies results of their corresponding threshold values are there. 

* In Results subdirectory, bestmodel and besttest text files are the results, which we are looking for.

The remainingstocks directory holds all of the strategies and their stocks, also in order to execute the code, only thing needs to do is:
- from the command line 'python3 PortfolioOptimisation.py' would be enough.

Thank you.


Necessary modules:
- numpy
- pandas
- yfinance
